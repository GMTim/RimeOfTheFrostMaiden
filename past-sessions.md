### Session 1 (01/24/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- Met a group of dwarves (Hruna, Korux, Storn) who lost a load of ore on the way to Bryn Shander from Kelvin's Cairn. They claim to have been accosted by a yeti, and forced to flee. Their injuries would agree with them. They have offered each member of your party a "fat shiny gem" for returning their ore to the Blackiron Blades smithy in Bryn Shander.
- You visited The Northlook Inn and Tavern, and secured a set of rooms for the next 10 day.
- You met a dwarf at The Northlook Inn named Hlin Trollbane. He offered to pay you each 100gp to murder a man he suspects of being a serial killer. The man, Sephek Kaltro is traveling with a nefarious group known as Torg's Caravan. The killings have taken place in Byrn Shander, Targos, and Easthaven.
- Hlin Trollbane told you everything he knows about yeti's, which is they are smart, mean, strong, and will ambush you. They are not venomous or prone to extended stalkings or revenge. They are not susceptible to the cold.
- Milla overheard in The Northlook that Speaker Masthew in Termalaine had to close the mine due to a gang of kobolds endangering the mines. Apparently anyone who clears them out can expect to be well compensated.
- Leopold overheard in The Northlook that a white moose has been terrorizing Lonelywood. It has so far completely evaded capture by all the hunters and trappers who have sought it out.
- Gimble learned of Mishann, an elven worshipper of Amaunator, or as she was quick to point out The Morninglord.
- The party went and met with Duvessa Shane, Speaker of Bryn Shander, and learned about the sacrifices each town makes in an attempt to appease Auril, the goddess of winter. Some towns sacrifices warmth, some food, and some people. You know for a fact Bryn Shander and Easthaven sacrifice people. Byrn Shander uses a lottery system of folks who live in the town.

Session Ended on late afternoon of `Nightal 20 - 1489DR`

### Session 2 (01/31/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You set out to find the lost ore coming from Kelvin's Cairn to Bryn Shander. You traveled for hours into the late afternoon and then evening, finally finding the site where the dwarves at been attacked. However, after a thorough investigation, you discovered that the ore had been found and taken by some small creatures, a large wagon, and some bears. You followed their tracks, but found yourselves caught up in a deadly blizzard. Thankfully, Nobu was able to guild you through the worst of it and you came upon the wagon. You discovered the wagon was owned by goblins, and being dragged by a couple of polar bears. After some tense moments, the goblins agreed to give you the ore in exchange for you murdering their leader. After some debate, you dragged this fat and warm goblin out of the wagon, and despite his efforts, tied him up and threw him to the bears. The rest of the goblins invited you to wait out the blizzard, which took a few more hours to settle down. After which you used a floating disk spell to drag the sled of ore back to Bryn Shander where you where each awarded a gem worth 50gp. Exhausted after spending the whole night in the wilderness you went to sleep.

**Nightal 21 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You questioned your next steps, and decided to spend the rest of the day in Bryn Shander, before making your way to one of the other Ten Towns the next day. Most of you traded in your gems for coin, and all of you purchased a set of Snow Shoes to make walking the roads much easier.
- Nobu wandered around town, and after much rejection was asked to find a Snow Snipe. He later learned that this was not a real animal, but a joke one of the residents of Bryn Shander played on him.
- Bruno indebted himself to the dwarves of the Blackiron Blades in exchange for partially financing a set of Chainmail. With the help of Mightor his debt is already mostly repaid.
- Elmfrid set about telling the tale of the goblins from the night before, leaving out the pack made with goblins, and instead explaining the party had simply killed them all.
- The party heard that Targos has a band of adventurers planning an expedition up the side of Kelvin's Cairn, where they will look for Oyaminartok, a goliath werepolar bear. There might still be time to join their expedition.
- The party heard that Caer-Konig is being beset by vandals and thieves that skulk about unseen. The town speaker, a dragonborn named Trovus, could use some help catching these interlopers.
- Milla has begun the exciting journey to speaking Abyssal, the language of the lower planes. Assisted by Deathlord.
- Leopold has created a set of introduction papers designed to look as official and authoritative as possible, working through the day and night, and with the assistance of the others in the party who already have similar documentation.

Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 22 - 1489DR` after a long rest.

### Session 3 (02/07/23)
**Nightal 22 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You set out and head towards Torgos, which takes a few hours of your morning to get to.

_[Targos](./locations/targos.md)_

- Outside of the wooden palisades of Targos, you are met by a panicked dog. Following it, you are led to the home of Keegan and Garret Velryn. Keegan tells you the dog, named Guy, was the lead of his husband Garret's dog team. He was leading an expedition up Kelvin's Cairn, and if this dog is here that means something terrible has happened. Keegan, worried about his husband, has asked your group to find him and hopefully return him safely home. He offered your group free rooms at the Luskan Arms, the local inn in Targos. He also offered you a few small scrimshaw figurings, but you turned them down. Keegan then tells you that he doesn't know where Garret's base camp would be, but that he traveled to the Frozenfar Expeditions in Caer-Konig, and someone there might know.
- Your party set out from Targos, spending most of the day to walk around to Caer-Dineval on your way to Caer-Konig.

_[Caer-Dineval](./locations/caer-dineval.md)_

- As _night_ approached, and the winter cold threatened to drop the temperature even more, you decided to stop over in Caer-Dineval. Asking around, you discover that the inn, Dinev's Rest, was permanently closed. However the tavern, The Uphill Climb, might have a fire you could sleep next to. You make your way to the tavern, where you meet a burly tavern keep named Roark. He allows you use of his extra rooms in exchange for you finding out what happened to the town's speaker, Crannoc Siever. He tells you he is up in the old Caer, and has in the past months surrounded himself with outsiders from the south. He also tells you that you can't miss the man, he is very loud.
- Deciding that you have time that evening, you approach the Caer, and after a bit of scouting, make your presence known. An albino tiefling woman named Avarice (a typical example of a tiefling name). She invites you into a cozy and warm study, and assures you that the speaker is simply ill, but will recover. She accepts your writ as emissaries of the Host Tower without any hesitation, though Milla did detect a bit of sly understanding in her when she did. As you had a pleasant discussion, she asked you that if you'd be willing, to check out the dock's where the frozen ferry is. Saying no more about why. She also subtly would steer the conversation away from why she was here in the north in the first place.
- Death Lord, wishing to be away from the warmth, took her leave, and on a whim decided to check out the ferry alone. There she discovered a ferry frozen in the lake, and when she climbed aboard found the door was slightly ajar. She lit a torch and went in, going below decks to discover a table with some parchments and a black crystal on a chain. She took the crystal and the parchments (written in dwarven) and attempted to leave when she was ambushed by a duergar. Thankfully, before entering the ferry she had cast false life on herself, and with the added protection was able to withstand several blows from the duergar's warpick. She successfully fled into the night, and got safely back to the tavern, a little worse for wear.
- Looking over the papers, the party discovered that there is some duergar fortress near by in the mountains, it's exact location unknown, and that the duergar are planing something that suggests they mean to destroy the ten towns. The parchements don't explain the plan, but it's not hard to read between the lines.
- The party durning their stay discovers that Torg's Caravan, the company that Sephek Kaltro, the serial killer you've been hired to murder, will be in Easthaven on Nightal 27. Five days from when you discovered this information.
- The party then rests that night looking to head out to Caer-Konig, and the Frozenfar Expeditions in the morning.

Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 23 - 1489DR` after a long rest.

### Session 4 (02/21/23)
**Nightal 23 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Caer-Dineval](./locations/caer-dineval.md)_

- You set out for [Caer-Konig](./locations/caer-konig.md), and make it there after a few hours of walking.

_[Caer-Konig](./locations/caer-konig.md)_

- When you arrive in the town, you happen to walk by the Northern Light Inn, where a white dragonborn pops out of the snow accusing you of being thieves. You accuse him back while also establishing this is Trovus, the speaker of Caer-Konig. A couple of women from the inn come out and help the speaker in, asking you to come back when you have time to help them with their actual thief problem.
- You make your way to the Frozenfar Expeditions, where you meet Atenas Swift, he tells you that Garret's expedition had come through here and that Jarthra Farzassh would know more.
- Jarthra tells you that Garret has planned on using a base camp she told him about. She then tells you where that is, and offers to guide you there for a fee, which you turn down.
- Gimble buys a couple of dogs, Gerrty and Gumdrop, along with ridding saddles for both of them. Bruno buys a dog sled. You now have an axebeak and two dogs in the party.

_Kelvin's Cairn_

- You travel for a good part of the day, part of that through a blizzard, and finally make it to the base camp where you discover the rest of Garret's dog team, and a set of tattered tents.
- You make your way up the side of the mountain, and are bleated at by some mountain goats. Maybe they where trying to warn you, or maybe they are just jerks, but soon after that an avalanche crashed into your party. Most of you successfully got out of the way of the sliding snow and rocks. Leopold and Greg however got caught in the landslide. Thankfully they survived, and other then being exhausted by the ordeal where none the worse for wear. The rest of you dug them out, and kept making your way up the mountain.
- Farther up the mountain you came across Garret who had fallen into a crevasse. You pulled him out and he told you of a yeti attack farther up the mountain. He said he was traveling with a halfling named Perilou Fishfinger, a goliath named Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi, and a tiefling named Astrix. He was pretty sure Mokingo was dead as last he saw the man had engaged the yeti hand to hand.
- The party then climbed up a fairly sheer area, making it to the top where they discovered a cave. Outside of it was a dead goliath, who has been stripped of his meat. Inside was a mother yeti and a yeti tyke who was playing with the halfling as if she was a ball. Leopold read their thoughts and discovered that the yeti's where having a grand time, while Perilou was not.
- Bruno set an alarm spell at the entrance of the cave, and then the party lead by Mightor went in. Mightor grabbed the yeti tyke and threatened it harm unless the yeti kept back. With Milla and Leopold's uncanny abilities, communication was possible with the beast, and she pleaded with the party to just leave and not to harm her son. As the halfling was escorted away, the alarm spell went off, and party was alerted to the yeti father approaching from behind. Mightor through the psionically aided communication was able to demand their passage, and the whole party with the recovered Perilou was able to make it to safety. Elmfrid then used his ability to increase gravity to cause a small avalanche to temporally seal in the yetis.
- Perilou corroborated what Garret had told the party, and added that Astrix has fled up the mountain last she saw. The party continued their climb where they discovered poor Astrix's frozen body, with her last action trying and failing to start a fire. Along with her was an unknown dwarf who must have frozen up here before Astrix got there. In his belonging where a miner's pack, inside of which contained the needed tools to start a fire, making Astrix's fate even more cruel. On her body a potion of invisibility and a wizard's spellbook where found.
- The party and surviving members of Garret's expedition made their way down the mountain, and across the wilderness back to Caer-Konig in the early hours of the morning.

### Session 1 (01/24/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- Met a group of dwarves (Hruna, Korux, Storn) who lost a load of ore on the way to Bryn Shander from Kelvin's Cairn. They claim to have been accosted by a yeti, and forced to flee. Their injuries would agree with them. They have offered each member of your party a "fat shiny gem" for returning their ore to the Blackiron Blades smithy in Bryn Shander.
- You visited The Northlook Inn and Tavern, and secured a set of rooms for the next 10 day.
- You met a dwarf at The Northlook Inn named Hlin Trollbane. He offered to pay you each 100gp to murder a man he suspects of being a serial killer. The man, Sephek Kaltro is traveling with a nefarious group known as Torg's Caravan. The killings have taken place in Byrn Shander, Targos, and Easthaven.
- Hlin Trollbane told you everything he knows about yeti's, which is they are smart, mean, strong, and will ambush you. They are not venomous or prone to extended stalkings or revenge. They are not susceptible to the cold.
- Milla overheard in The Northlook that Speaker Masthew in Termalaine had to close the mine due to a gang of kobolds endangering the mines. Apparently anyone who clears them out can expect to be well compensated.
- Leopold overheard in The Northlook that a white moose has been terrorizing Lonelywood. It has so far completely evaded capture by all the hunters and trappers who have sought it out.
- Gimble learned of Mishann, an elven worshipper of Amaunator, or as she was quick to point out The Morninglord.
- The party went and met with Duvessa Shane, Speaker of Bryn Shander, and learned about the sacrifices each town makes in an attempt to appease Auril, the goddess of winter. Some towns sacrifices warmth, some food, and some people. You know for a fact Bryn Shander and Easthaven sacrifice people. Byrn Shander uses a lottery system of folks who live in the town.

Session Ended on late afternoon of `Nightal 20 - 1489DR`

### Session 2 (01/31/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You set out to find the lost ore coming from Kelvin's Cairn to Bryn Shander. You traveled for hours into the late afternoon and then evening, finally finding the site where the dwarves at been attacked. However, after a thorough investigation, you discovered that the ore had been found and taken by some small creatures, a large wagon, and some bears. You followed their tracks, but found yourselves caught up in a deadly blizzard. Thankfully, Nobu was able to guild you through the worst of it and you came upon the wagon. You discovered the wagon was owned by goblins, and being dragged by a couple of polar bears. After some tense moments, the goblins agreed to give you the ore in exchange for you murdering their leader. After some debate, you dragged this fat and warm goblin out of the wagon, and despite his efforts, tied him up and threw him to the bears. The rest of the goblins invited you to wait out the blizzard, which took a few more hours to settle down. After which you used a floating disk spell to drag the sled of ore back to Bryn Shander where you where each awarded a gem worth 50gp. Exhausted after spending the whole night in the wilderness you went to sleep.

**Nightal 21 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You questioned your next steps, and decided to spend the rest of the day in Bryn Shander, before making your way to one of the other Ten Towns the next day. Most of you traded in your gems for coin, and all of you purchased a set of Snow Shoes to make walking the roads much easier.
- Nobu wandered around town, and after much rejection was asked to find a Snow Snipe. He later learned that this was not a real animal, but a joke one of the residents of Bryn Shander played on him.
- Bruno indebted himself to the dwarves of the Blackiron Blades in exchange for partially financing a set of Chainmail. With the help of Mightor his debt is already mostly repaid.
- Elmfrid set about telling the tale of the goblins from the night before, leaving out the pack made with goblins, and instead explaining the party had simply killed them all.
- The party heard that Targos has a band of adventurers planning an expedition up the side of Kelvin's Cairn, where they will look for Oyaminartok, a goliath werepolar bear. There might still be time to join their expedition.
- The party heard that Caer-Konig is being beset by vandals and thieves that skulk about unseen. The town speaker, a dragonborn named Trovus, could use some help catching these interlopers.
- Milla has begun the exciting journey to speaking Abyssal, the language of the lower planes. Assisted by Deathlord.
- Leopold has created a set of introduction papers designed to look as official and authoritative as possible, working through the day and night, and with the assistance of the others in the party who already have similar documentation.

Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 22 - 1489DR` after a long rest.

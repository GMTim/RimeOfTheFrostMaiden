### Session 1 (01/24/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- Met a group of dwarves (Hruna, Korux, Storn) who lost a load of ore on the way to Bryn Shander from Kelvin's Cairn. They claim to have been accosted by a yeti, and forced to flee. Their injuries would agree with them. They have offered each member of your party a "fat shiny gem" for returning their ore to the Blackiron Blades smithy in Bryn Shander.
- You visited The Northlook Inn and Tavern, and secured a set of rooms for the next 10 day.
- You met a dwarf at The Northlook Inn named Hlin Trollbane. He offered to pay you each 100gp to murder a man he suspects of being a serial killer. The man, Sephek Kaltro is traveling with a nefarious group known as Torg's Caravan. The killings have taken place in Byrn Shander, Targos, and Easthaven.
- Hlin Trollbane told you everything he knows about yeti's, which is they are smart, mean, strong, and will ambush you. They are not venomous or prone to extended stalkings or revenge. They are not susceptible to the cold.
- Milla overheard in The Northlook that Speaker Masthew in Termalaine had to close the mine due to a gang of kobolds endangering the mines. Apparently anyone who clears them out can expect to be well compensated.
- Leopold overheard in The Northlook that a white moose has been terrorizing Lonelywood. It has so far completely evaded capture by all the hunters and trappers who have sought it out.
- Gimble learned of Mishann, an elven worshipper of Amaunator, or as she was quick to point out The Morninglord.
- The party went and met with Duvessa Shane, Speaker of Bryn Shander, and learned about the sacrifices each town makes in an attempt to appease Auril, the goddess of winter. Some towns sacrifices warmth, some food, and some people. You know for a fact Bryn Shander and Easthaven sacrifice people. Byrn Shander uses a lottery system of folks who live in the town.

Session Ended on late afternoon of `Nightal 20 - 1489DR`

### Session 2 (01/31/23)
**Nightal 20 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You set out to find the lost ore coming from Kelvin's Cairn to Bryn Shander. You traveled for hours into the late afternoon and then evening, finally finding the site where the dwarves at been attacked. However, after a thorough investigation, you discovered that the ore had been found and taken by some small creatures, a large wagon, and some bears. You followed their tracks, but found yourselves caught up in a deadly blizzard. Thankfully, Nobu was able to guild you through the worst of it and you came upon the wagon. You discovered the wagon was owned by goblins, and being dragged by a couple of polar bears. After some tense moments, the goblins agreed to give you the ore in exchange for you murdering their leader. After some debate, you dragged this fat and warm goblin out of the wagon, and despite his efforts, tied him up and threw him to the bears. The rest of the goblins invited you to wait out the blizzard, which took a few more hours to settle down. After which you used a floating disk spell to drag the sled of ore back to Bryn Shander where you where each awarded a gem worth 50gp. Exhausted after spending the whole night in the wilderness you went to sleep.

**Nightal 21 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You questioned your next steps, and decided to spend the rest of the day in Bryn Shander, before making your way to one of the other Ten Towns the next day. Most of you traded in your gems for coin, and all of you purchased a set of Snow Shoes to make walking the roads much easier.
- Nobu wandered around town, and after much rejection was asked to find a Snow Snipe. He later learned that this was not a real animal, but a joke one of the residents of Bryn Shander played on him.
- Bruno indebted himself to the dwarves of the Blackiron Blades in exchange for partially financing a set of Chainmail. With the help of Mightor his debt is already mostly repaid.
- Elmfrid set about telling the tale of the goblins from the night before, leaving out the pack made with goblins, and instead explaining the party had simply killed them all.
- The party heard that Targos has a band of adventurers planning an expedition up the side of Kelvin's Cairn, where they will look for Oyaminartok, a goliath werepolar bear. There might still be time to join their expedition.
- The party heard that Caer-Konig is being beset by vandals and thieves that skulk about unseen. The town speaker, a dragonborn named Trovus, could use some help catching these interlopers.
- Milla has begun the exciting journey to speaking Abyssal, the language of the lower planes. Assisted by Deathlord.
- Leopold has created a set of introduction papers designed to look as official and authoritative as possible, working through the day and night, and with the assistance of the others in the party who already have similar documentation.

Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 22 - 1489DR` after a long rest.

### Session 3 (02/07/23)
**Nightal 22 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Bryn Shander](./locations/bryn-shander.md)_

- You set out and head towards Torgos, which takes a few hours of your morning to get to.

_[Targos](./locations/targos.md)_

- Outside of the wooden palisades of Targos, you are met by a panicked dog. Following it, you are led to the home of Keegan and Garret Velryn. Keegan tells you the dog, named Guy, was the lead of his husband Garret's dog team. He was leading an expedition up Kelvin's Cairn, and if this dog is here that means something terrible has happened. Keegan, worried about his husband, has asked your group to find him and hopefully return him safely home. He offered your group free rooms at the Luskan Arms, the local inn in Targos. He also offered you a few small scrimshaw figurings, but you turned them down. Keegan then tells you that he doesn't know where Garret's base camp would be, but that he traveled to the Frozenfar Expeditions in Caer-Konig, and someone there might know.
- Your party set out from Targos, spending most of the day to walk around to Caer-Dineval on your way to Caer-Konig.

_[Caer-Dineval](./locations/caer-dineval.md)_

- As _night_ approached, and the winter cold threatened to drop the temperature even more, you decided to stop over in Caer-Dineval. Asking around, you discover that the inn, Dinev's Rest, was permanently closed. However the tavern, The Uphill Climb, might have a fire you could sleep next to. You make your way to the tavern, where you meet a burly tavern keep named Roark. He allows you use of his extra rooms in exchange for you finding out what happened to the town's speaker, Crannoc Siever. He tells you he is up in the old Caer, and has in the past months surrounded himself with outsiders from the south. He also tells you that you can't miss the man, he is very loud.
- Deciding that you have time that evening, you approach the Caer, and after a bit of scouting, make your presence known. An albino tiefling woman named Avarice (a typical example of a tiefling name). She invites you into a cozy and warm study, and assures you that the speaker is simply ill, but will recover. She accepts your writ as emissaries of the Host Tower without any hesitation, though Milla did detect a bit of sly understanding in her when she did. As you had a pleasant discussion, she asked you that if you'd be willing, to check out the dock's where the frozen ferry is. Saying no more about why. She also subtly would steer the conversation away from why she was here in the north in the first place.
- Death Lord, wishing to be away from the warmth, took her leave, and on a whim decided to check out the ferry alone. There she discovered a ferry frozen in the lake, and when she climbed aboard found the door was slightly ajar. She lit a torch and went in, going below decks to discover a table with some parchments and a black crystal on a chain. She took the crystal and the parchments (written in dwarven) and attempted to leave when she was ambushed by a duergar. Thankfully, before entering the ferry she had cast false life on herself, and with the added protection was able to withstand several blows from the duergar's warpick. She successfully fled into the night, and got safely back to the tavern, a little worse for wear.
- Looking over the papers, the party discovered that there is some duergar fortress near by in the mountains, it's exact location unknown, and that the duergar are planing something that suggests they mean to destroy the ten towns. The parchements don't explain the plan, but it's not hard to read between the lines.
- The party durning their stay discovers that Torg's Caravan, the company that Sephek Kaltro, the serial killer you've been hired to murder, will be in Easthaven on Nightal 27. Five days from when you discovered this information.
- The party then rests that night looking to head out to Caer-Konig, and the Frozenfar Expeditions in the morning.

Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 23 - 1489DR` after a long rest.

### Session 4 (02/21/23)
**Nightal 23 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Caer-Dineval](./locations/caer-dineval.md)_

- You set out for Caer-Konig, and make it there after a few hours of walking.

_[Caer-Konig](./locations/caer-konig.md)_

- When you arrive in the town, you happen to walk by the Northern Light Inn, where a white dragonborn pops out of the snow accusing you of being thieves. You accuse him back while also establishing this is Trovus, the speaker of Caer-Konig. A couple of women from the inn come out and help the speaker in, asking you to come back when you have time to help them with their actual thief problem.
- You make your way to the Frozenfar Expeditions, where you meet Atenas Swift, he tells you that Garret's expedition had come through here and that Jarthra Farzassh would know more.
- Jarthra tells you that Garret has planned on using a base camp she told him about. She then tells you where that is, and offers to guide you there for a fee, which you turn down.
- Gimble buys a couple of dogs, Gerrty and Gumdrop, along with ridding saddles for both of them. Bruno buys a dog sled. You now have an axebeak and two dogs in the party.

_Kelvin's Cairn_

- You travel for a good part of the day, part of that through a blizzard, and finally make it to the base camp where you discover the rest of Garret's dog team, and a set of tattered tents.
- You make your way up the side of the mountain, and are bleated at by some mountain goats. Maybe they where trying to warn you, or maybe they are just jerks, but soon after that an avalanche crashed into your party. Most of you successfully got out of the way of the sliding snow and rocks. Leopold and Greg however got caught in the landslide. Thankfully they survived, and other then being exhausted by the ordeal where none the worse for wear. The rest of you dug them out, and kept making your way up the mountain.
- Farther up the mountain you came across Garret who had fallen into a crevasse. You pulled him out and he told you of a yeti attack farther up the mountain. He said he was traveling with a halfling named Perilou Fishfinger, a goliath named Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi, and a tiefling named Astrix. He was pretty sure Mokingo was dead as last he saw the man had engaged the yeti hand to hand.
- The party then climbed up a fairly sheer area, making it to the top where they discovered a cave. Outside of it was a dead goliath, who has been stripped of his meat. Inside was a mother yeti and a yeti tyke who was playing with the halfling as if she was a ball. Leopold read their thoughts and discovered that the yeti's where having a grand time, while Perilou was not.
- Bruno set an alarm spell at the entrance of the cave, and then the party lead by Mightor went in. Mightor grabbed the yeti tyke and threatened it harm unless the yeti kept back. With Milla and Leopold's uncanny abilities, communication was possible with the beast, and she pleaded with the party to just leave and not to harm her son. As the halfling was escorted away, the alarm spell went off, and party was alerted to the yeti father approaching from behind. Mightor through the psionically aided communication was able to demand their passage, and the whole party with the recovered Perilou was able to make it to safety. Elmfrid then used his ability to increase gravity to cause a small avalanche to temporally seal in the yetis.
- Perilou corroborated what Garret had told the party, and added that Astrix has fled up the mountain last she saw. The party continued their climb where they discovered poor Astrix's frozen body, with her last action trying and failing to start a fire. Along with her was an unknown dwarf who must have frozen up here before Astrix got there. In his belonging where a miner's pack, inside of which contained the needed tools to start a fire, making Astrix's fate even more cruel. On her body a potion of invisibility and a wizard's spellbook where found.
- The party and surviving members of Garret's expedition made their way down the mountain, and across the wilderness back to Caer-Konig in the early hours of the morning.

### Session 5 (02/28/23)
**Nightal 24 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Caer-Konig](./locations/caer-konig.md)_

- On the morning of Nightal 24, your group decided to make it's way down to Easthaven, to wait for Sephek Kaltro. You spent many hours walking there.

_[Easthaven](./locations/easthaven.md)_

- You get to Easthaven in time to see a wizard being burned at the stake, his many terrible crimes where listed before he was set to the torch by Imdra Arlaggath, the elven captain of Easthaven's militia.
- After the crowd dispersed, Imdar spots your group, and asks you to do her a favor. Some fishermen have gone missing, and along with that folks talking about seeing something out in the lake. She asks you to walk the shore of the lake and find out what happened to the fishermen, and see if there is any truth to the sightings. She offers you gold, or free room and board, you decide to take the free room and board.

_Howling Caverns_

- You head out to walk the shore, and about an hour later you come across a fishing boat. The boat still has all of the gear and supplies in it a fisher would need, but no sign of the men. Near by is a set of cliffs usually only accessible by boat, but now accessible by frozen lake water. Tracks from the boat make you believe the fishermen might have gone into caves in the side of the cliff.
- You make your way into the southern most cave, walking along a frozen river up to a water fall. There Milla spots a bag in the ice, and in an effort to free it accidentally shattered some of the ice, which quickly formed into some sort of water elemental and tried to land-drown her. You forced it to drop her, and it fled toward the nearby lake, which you where happy to let it do.
- After climbing up the frozen waterfall, you come to a icy bridge above you. You decide to climb up where you find a set of caverns that wail loudly like a woman screeching, an effect you determine to be caused by the wind blowing into the caves. You also find an old campsite where an unknown dwarf had been staying. They kept a journal, but most of it was ruined beyond comprehension. The bits not ruined read as follows:
  - The cave are sacred to the frost giants. The carvings on the wall suggest that the giants came here to drown themselves. Did they use the hot spring as a sacrificial pool? 
  - The wind truly sounds like a wailing woman. One could easily go mad in this place.
  - I think there's someone living in these caves. Shortly after discovering the hot spring, I heard what sounded like a granny singing. When the song ended with a shrill laugh, dread sunk its teeth in me. Ye gods, that horrible cackle! I shall leave these caves in the morning and never return.
- After that you continued along the frozen river, and came across a large pool where you could clearly see the remains of many giants deep in it's frozen waters. You could also smell something terrible with a hint of something savory up ahead.
- Elmfrid decided to scout ahead by flying up to a passage above the rest of the party, and then spotted an old woman cooking something in a large stew pot. The old woman made a show of adding in some meat to the stew, and then a human foot. Elmfrid retreated to the party, and when they tried to decide what to do next, a sea hag rushed them. Trying to make them flee with her terrifying visage. When this failed, she called on the dead of the caverns to rise up, which caused the frozen skeletons to begin clawing their way out of the ice. The party wasted no time in putting the boots to the hag, and she attempted to surrender calling for a parley. Deathlord then killed her without hearing her out, which caused the cave they where in to start to collapse.
- Gimble and Greg, who had already started to flee, made it out of the cave in time to see a pack of dire wolves also flee. The rest of the party took some time and figured out that the cauldron was in fact a powerful magic item called the Cauldron of Plenty, and was being used by the hag in a fowl way. They dumped it out and then took it with them as they fled just before the collapse of the cave.
- Unfortunately Deathlord and Bruno got trapped in the falling rocks. Quick thinking from Milla and an unusual use of feather fall, allowed her to save Deathlord, but Bruno's chest had been caved in by the falling rocks (pun intended).
- Unknown to the rest of the party, Bruno's soul had been plucked up by Moradin, the All-Father, into His holy forge made of a star. There He offered Bruno a choice, he could return to the living as a dwarf in truth, but his drow side would be forged and sent back as well. Or he could join Moradin in the forge forever more. Bruno chose to return to the living, and so Moradin worked his soul on the forge, purging him of his drow side and putting it back in to his now healed body.

_[Easthaven](./locations/easthaven.md)_

- The party made their way back to Easthaven, where Imdra gave them not only the room and board, but also 100gp and a rapier to Milla from her personal collection. She also agreed to train Mightor in the way of the Fighter. After that you all decided to hunker down until Nightal 27, when Sephek Kaltro was suppose to make his way into town.

Session Ended on evening of `Nightal 26 - 1489DR` after almost 3 days of downtime.

### Session 6 (03/07/23)
**Nightal 26 - 1489DR "The Year of the Warrior Princess"**  
_[Easthaven](./locations/easthaven.md)_

- On the evening before your quarry is set to arrive, you staying at the White Lady Inn, and a halfling named Rinaldo invited you to a seance. There he channels the White Lady, a spirit of a long deceased woman whom the inn gets it's name. You find out that the Duergar are in all three cities around Lac Dinneshere. You also find out that in life, she was a slaver and an evil woman, though she did not want to impart that information to you. You quickly come to the realization that she is more than just a channeled presence, that she's also a poltergeist. Based on how strong her presence was here, you came to the conclusion that whatever she was haunting, it must have been brought much closer then it was originally. Rinaldo then remembers that they just brought in some piece of a boat from out on the lake, and that it's in the town hall right now.
- Elmfrid decided to scout out the city, and while flying by the town hall he saw an object in a back room through a window. Taking a closer look he spotted a large ships figurehead, and tied to it a soaking wet woman all in white with white hair. When he looked away and back up she was no longer there. Returning to the party, it was decided that now was the time to deal with this while the city slept, and you all went and woke up Captain Imdara. Annoyed, but willing to humor you, she opened the town hall for you to investigate. You gave he a bag of salt, and asked her to ring the building with it. She seemed dubious at first, but agreed to do it anyway. Once inside, you concocted a plan to keep the woman busy while Bruno with his knowledge of true names, and this ghostly woman in particular, would work a ritual designed to bind her to the ethereal plane so you could figure out a more permeant solution.
- With your plan in place, you all rushed in to confront the ghost, where Deathlord immediately froze up. It turns out the figurehead is made out of the same crystal as the one Deathlord found before, and a presence in the crystal had wormed its way into her thoughts, pretending to be here. While she stood wrestling with what she thought as her own thoughts, the White Lady added Bruno. She tried to posses him, but his dwarven stubbornness cast her back. And a barrage of magics from the other wizards in the party hurt and confused her. She tried again on others, each time being barraged by magics, until she finally possessed Elmfrid.
- Using Elmfrid's natural ability to fly, she took to the air and avoided the rest of your attempts to grab him. Milla then cast feather fall on him in an effort to thwart his ability to fly, but he quickly compensated by simply flapping down when the need arose. He made it out the front door of the town hall cackling with glee, until ghost hit salt circle. Harshly and painfully the White Lady was thrown back way from the salt, while Elmfrid, still under the effect of Feather Fall drifted down to the snowy ground. Dumbfounded, Captain Imdara saw the whole thing, but Elmfrid assured her they had everything under control before making his way back inside the hall.
- While this was happening, Bruno using the figurehead as a focus for his ritual, began to understand that a second presence was with them. A malevolent being in the figurehead had coils of black ethereal rope bound around the White Lady. Along with that, Bruno could see tendrils of black reaching out, including a thin one reaching over to Deathlord's pack. He could also her the inner argument in Deathlord's mind, and realized one of the voiced was not actually Deathlord's. When Burno completed the ritual, binding the ghost to the ethereal for a year and a day (he hoped), he made a passing thread at the being, who simply laughed at him.
- After the battle, you found out the figurehead had been brought here, because it was causing folks near it to become corrupted, and so it was decided to try and destroy it, but so far nothing seems to be able to. Captain Imdara charged the party with finding out how to deal with it, and other crystals that may be found. Also, as the party discussed the events of that evening the revelation of Duergar in the area came up, and Captain Imdara also charged them with keeping her informed about that as well. Offering a reward for information and actions taken against them. She also offered them a reward for the nights work, and asked them to find her tomorrow after she has had a chance to sleep. The party then returns to the White Lady Inn for a long rest.


Session Ended on morning of `Nightal 27 - 1489DR`.
